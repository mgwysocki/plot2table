This project is still very much in alpha state.  It has been built using Qt 4.1.4 on Mac OSX 10.4.9 and Scientific Linux 3.0.3.  All other configurations are at your own risk.

To build, just use "make".  To be sure your Makefile is correct you should probably run qmake first.  The configuration itself is stored in datathief.pro.  My "To Do" list is in notes.rtf, sorry if you can't read Mac rich-text files.

Binaries for Windows, Mac, and Linux are written to datathief.exe, datathief.app, and datathief, respectively.

I've included a simple plot for tests, dimu_v2.gif.  When launching datathief, you can give an image as a command-line argument, and it will be automatically placed in the Open dialog.

Error bar input is still undocumented (since I haven't settled on a scheme).  There are a whole boatload of things I haven't implemented yet.  You might want to remove the DEBUG define from datathief.pro, otherwise the output file is always "points.dat", and there is a lot of stuff printed to the terminal.  Like I said, alpha-quality.

Please don't use this for a published plot; I'm not responsible for you being stoned, tarred and feathered at a conference, or worse, denied tenure.

Oh, and this is all under Gnu Public License, or one of those other fancy licenses that lawyers came up with, so don't steal (besides data points, that is).  And the name will change as soon as I come up with a super-swank name to replace Datathief (which is actually some twenty-year-old program from the Dark Ages that you can't find anywhere).
